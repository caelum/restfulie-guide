h1. Configuring the rails server

h2. Installing ruby and rails

The Ruby on Rails website [http://www.rubyonrails.org] provides a simple guide on how to install the latest version of the Ruby language and Rails framework.

First of all, follow its instructions and we are ready to start a hypermedia based system using Rails.

h2. Creating a new project

Running rails will allow the framework to create the entire project structure, ready to use:

<pre>
rails hotel-system
cd hotel-system
</pre>

But Rails standard projects still do not support hypermedia resources, therefore its required to add restfulie gem at **hotel-system/config/enviroment.rb**:

<pre>
config.gem "restfulie", :version => "0.6.0", :source => "http://gemcutter.org"
</pre>

Because gems handles gem dependencies, one single command shall download all required gems: restfulie and its dependencies.

<pre>
rake gems:install
</pre>

h2. Rails foregery protection

Because Rails provides out of the box support to 'forgery' we need to turn it off. This forgery protection does not allow a client to access a POST method without previously passing through the form display process. Because this is not the desired behavior for rest applications over http, we add one line of code to  **hotel-system/config/enviroments/development.rb**:

<pre>
config.action_controller.allow_forgery_protection    = false
</pre>

h2. Running the server

In order to start the server in your machine and the default port 3000, run the following command in your terminal:

<pre>
script/server
</pre>

Now we can access the hotel system by pointing our browser to **http://localhost:3000**.
