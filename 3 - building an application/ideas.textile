LATER SOFT DELETE
In our system we will not allow hotels to be entirely removed from our database as the links pointing to it are required to remain valid even after its 'removal', therefore a soft delete will be executed through a <b>removed</b> flag created in the hotel table.
note: in this case, I cannot use the DELETE verb (soft delete... read the information from the http verb definition)
note: keep both implementations: deleteand softdelete, with soft delete as make hotel unavailable
