h2. Searching through a list of resources

Our clients will want to search for a specific flight in our system, therefore an entry point that returns the entire list of flights as an atom feed is too much information: the entry point will display only a specific amount of results and then allow the client to filter it further, accessing a new list.

We will use the open search API that allows you to.

h2. Saving a search: creating a report


uris are ids while searching


h2. Another solution: hypermedia and parameters

A simple example is to start by accessing the entry point and then filtering outgoing flights from Sao Paulo.
